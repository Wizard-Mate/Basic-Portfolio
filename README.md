# Homework-2 - Professional Portfolio

My goal in this project was to create a basic portfolio to show off the work I will create in this Bootcamp. I found this project difficult, as flex boxs and items can behave in strange ways. I was guided by the following -

# User Story:

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.

# What I Did:

1. I created index.html, style.css, reset.css and ReadMe documents.
2. I used a semantic structure for my html elements.
3. I added discriptive comments in my html and css documents for easy comprehension.
4. I added my name, a recent photo and discriptive alt attributes for all images.
5. I added a discriptive title.
6. I added a navigation bar that links to relevent sections on page.
7. I created a flex container containing 5 titled applications.
8. I made the first applications image larger than the others - it links to deployed url.
9. I utilised media queries to create a responsive layout that adapts to a smaller screen size.
